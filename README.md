##### Development of an optimization route guide application for indoor fire evacuation using beacons

1. **Introduction**

   Still, damage to fire accidents continues to occur. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, the average number of fire accidents from 2010 to 2019 was 1,300,000.
   In detail, in 2019, 40.4% were externally occurring fires, 29.9% in residential spaces, 15.1% in vehicles, 9.4% in non-residential spaces, and 5.2% in other areas, and 39.3% of fires in buildings can be confirmed.
   In order to prevent accidents involving indoor fires, this study was conducted by developing an app that informs the optimal route for indoor fire evacuation by using beacons.

2. **Literature review**

   > Accuracy Study of Indoor Positioning with Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons, 2020​

   The average multiple measurements can increase the accuracy of indoor positioning.​

   > Evacuation Guidance System Using Beacon Information and ​Dijkstra’s Algorithm, 2021

   The average multiple measurements can increase the accuracy of indoor positioning.​

3. **Methodology**

   1. Application structure

   - When the manager uploads a blueprint for each floor, the application converts it to a map, and the administrator enters the name of each room Using Bluetooth beacon, the user’s location data is obtained. In peacetime, the application shows an optimized route to the destination that the user wants. In the event of a fire, a fire alarm that is linked to the server notifies the server of the occurrence of the fire, and the server notifies the user of the fire through the application. The application displays the current population cluster and the fastest escape route from the current user location on the map.
